In this exercise, we’ll change the fonts for the body and main heading of the Black Goose Bistro menu document. Open the menu.html in a text editor. You can also open it in a browser to see its “before” state.

I’ve included an embedded font in this exercise to show you how easy it is to do with a service like Google Web Fonts.

1. Use an embedded style sheet for this exercise. Start by adding a style element in the head of the document, like this:

<head>

<title>Black Goose Bistro</title>

<style>

</style>

</head>

2. I would like the main text to appear in Verdana or some other sans-serif font. Instead of writing a rule for every element in the document, we will write one rule for the body element that will be inherited by all the elements it contains. Add this rule to the embedded style sheet:

<style>

body {font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;}

</style>
